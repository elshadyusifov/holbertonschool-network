# What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser

**Blog Post:**

When you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter, a complex sequence of events happens behind the scenes that involves DNS, networking, security, load balancing, and server-side processing. Let’s break it down step by step:

### 1. DNS Request
The browser first checks its cache for the IP of `www.google.com`. If not found, it queries a DNS server to resolve the domain name to an IP address (e.g., 142.250.190.100).

### 2. TCP/IP
The browser opens a TCP connection to Google’s server using the resolved IP. TCP ensures reliable packet delivery.

### 3. Firewall
The request passes through firewalls (local, network, and server side) that allow or block traffic based on security rules.

### 4. HTTPS / SSL
Since the URL uses HTTPS, the browser initiates an SSL/TLS handshake to encrypt data between the browser and server.

### 5. Load Balancer
Google’s load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to balance load and ensure high availability.

### 6. Web Server
The web server (e.g., Nginx) serves static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

### 7. Application Server
The application server executes backend logic, processes queries, interacts with databases, and prepares the response.

### 8. Database
Dynamic data is fetched from a database. The application server queries it, receives the data, formats it, and sends it back to the web server.

### 9. Response to Browser
The web server sends the response over HTTPS. The browser renders the page, executes JavaScript, loads images, and finally displays the Google homepage.
